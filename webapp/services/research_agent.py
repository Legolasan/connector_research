### Loading Mode Selection
| Scenario | Loading Mode | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Initial Load | Full Overwrite | Replace all target data |
| Regular Sync | Incremental Append | Add new records only |
| Updates Detected | Upsert (Merge) | Insert or update based on key |
| SCD Required | Type 2 History | Maintain historical versions |

### Target System Considerations
| Target Type | Recommended Strategy | Batch Size | Parallelism |
|-------------|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| Data Warehouse | Bulk Insert | 10,000-100,000 | 4-8 threads |
| Data Lake | Partitioned Write | By date/key | Parallel partitions |
| Database | Batch Upsert | 1,000-5,000 | 2-4 connections |

### Merge/Upsert Logic
```sql
-- Provide SQL merge pattern for the target system
```

### Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)
| SCD Type | Use Case | Implementation |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Type 1 | Overwrite old values | UPDATE existing rows |
| Type 2 | Keep history | Add new row, close old |
| Type 3 | Limited history | Add previous value column |

### Prerequisites Checklist
- [ ] Admin access to {connector} account
- [ ] Network access to API endpoints verified
- [ ] Required permissions/scopes identified
- [ ] Development/sandbox environment available

### Step 1: Network Connectivity Verification
```bash
# Verify API endpoint is reachable
curl -I https://api.{connector}.com/health
# Expected: HTTP 200 OK
```

### Step 2: Application Registration
1. Navigate to Developer Portal / Admin Console
2. Create new application/integration
3. Configure OAuth redirect URIs (if applicable)
4. Note down: Client ID, Client Secret, API Key

### Step 3: Authentication Setup
```python
# Provide complete authentication code
# Include: token acquisition, refresh logic, error handling
```

### Step 4: Connection Test
```python
# Provide connection test code
# Verify: auth works, can list objects, can read data
```

### Step 5: Permissions Verification
```python
# Test each required permission/scope
# Document which objects each permission grants access to
```

### Troubleshooting Guide
| Symptom | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Connection timeout | Firewall blocking | Whitelist IPs |
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid credentials | Regenerate API key |
| 403 Forbidden | Missing permissions | Request additional scopes |
| 429 Rate Limited | Too many requests | Implement backoff |
| SSL Error | Certificate issue | Update CA bundle |

### Performance Benchmarks

|-----------|--------------------|-----------------| ------|
| List objects | X records/second | < 500ms | With pagination |
| Get single record | 1 record | < 200ms | By ID |
| Bulk export | X records/minute | N/A | Async job |
| Webhook delivery | Real-time | < 5 seconds | Event to receipt |

### Batch Size Recommendations
| API Type | Recommended Batch | Max Batch | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| REST List | 100-250 | 1000 | Balance throughput vs memory |
| Bulk API | 10,000 | 100,000 | Job processing time |
| Webhook | N/A | N/A | Event-driven |

### Scheduling Recommendations
| Sync Type | Frequency | Window | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Full Load | Weekly | Off-peak hours | High volume, low frequency |
| Incremental | Every 15-60 min | Continuous | Near real-time updates |
| CDC/Webhooks | Real-time | Continuous | Immediate consistency |

### Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Can run multiple extractors in parallel?
- **Rate Limit Sharing**: How are limits shared across instances?
- **Connection Pooling**: Recommended pool size and timeout settings

2. The table should include:
   - Object: Name of the entity/object (e.g., accounts, contacts, orders)
   - Extraction Method: Exact API endpoint or method (e.g., "GET /v1/accounts", "GraphQL query accounts", "SOAP GetAccounts")
   - Primary Key: The unique identifier field (e.g., id, account_id)
   - Cursor Field: Field for incremental sync (e.g., updated_at, modified_date) or "-" if full load only
   - Parent: Parent object name if this is a child entity, or "-" if top-level
   - Permissions: Required scopes/permissions (e.g., read:accounts, accounts.read)
   - Delete Method: How to detect deleted records. Use one of:
     * "Soft Delete (field_name)" - e.g., "Soft Delete (is_deleted)", "Soft Delete (deleted_at)"
     * "Deleted Endpoint" - API provides GET /deleted_records or similar
     * "Webhook (event_name)" - e.g., "Webhook (record.deleted)"
     * "Audit Log" - Deletions tracked in audit/activity endpoint
     * "None" - Hard deletes only, no detection available
   - Fivetran Support: "✓" if supported by Fivetran, "✗" if not, or "?" if unknown

3. After the table, include:
   - Replication Strategy Notes: List objects by category (Full Load Only, Incremental, CDC-capable)
   - Delete Detection Summary: Group objects by delete method
   - Sample Extraction Code: Python code example for 2-3 key objects with pagination
   - Volume Considerations: Rate limits or pagination specific to high-volume objects

4. Include inline citations like [web:1], [web:2] referencing web search results
5. If Fivetran context is provided, prioritize that for the Fivetran Support column
6. List at least 15-30 objects if available, or all objects if fewer exist

### 19.2 Replication Strategy Notes

**Full Load Objects:** (list objects with no cursor field)

**CDC-Capable Objects:** (list objects with real-time change tracking if any)

### 19.3 Delete Detection Summary

**Soft Delete:** (list objects with soft delete flag - specify field name)
**Deleted Endpoint:** (list objects with dedicated deleted records endpoint)
**Webhook:** (list objects with delete webhook events)
**Audit Log:** (list objects tracked via audit log)
**No Delete Detection:** (list objects with hard deletes only)
